To compile DGD on Windows you need to have Visual Studio 2010 or Visual C++ Express 2010.

You also will need to install GnuWin's Bison.

I recommend installing to a path with no spaces in it since the current version chokes on spaces.  You will also need to add the location of Bison.exe to your global PATH.

DGD for Windows is a console application and should be run just as it is on Unix-type operating systems.
