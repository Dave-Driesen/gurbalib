This directory contains additional software
that can be used with Gurbalib.

The packages in this directory come with their
own license, please read the documentation
included in those packages.

A few general notes:

DGD contains the gamedriver, which uses the AGPL
license. Please note that this license does not
affect the mudlib. You have to publish changes you
make to the driver if you let others connect to it,
but you do not have to publish your mudlib, it is
not affected by the AGPL license.

The Sprintf package uses the GPL license. It is not
entirely clear to me how this would affect the license
of the mudlib, use your own judgement.
