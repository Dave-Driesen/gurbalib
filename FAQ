Q: What do I do now that I have this stuff?
   Take a look at the doc dir.  You'll need to install things
   (read doc/INSTALLING)
   Then startup the mud
   Then login as someone (the first player will be an admin)   
   You will also probably want to look at the lib/doc directory

Q: When trying to start the mud, it complains about the file
   mudname.h not being there and then terminates.

A: You didn't use scripts/installer to configure the mud and
   install the driver. Please do so as it will ensure this
   file gets created properly.

   Alternatively:

   cd lib/kernel/include
   copy the file mudname.h.default to mudname.h and edit it
   to contain the name of your mud.

Q: When starting the mud, I get the following output:

A: The file lib/kernel/include/mudname.h does not define the
   IMUD_NAME macro, probably because you created an empty file
   there or removed that macro. 

   You should use scripts/installer to ensure the mudname.h
   file is created properly or do what is described above to
   create it yourself.

Q: I changed the Makefile to build the driver with -O or -O2
   and now it crashes.

A: Don't do this. It is not supported and the possible gain it
   could give is very small.
