Unpack the distribution into a directory
then cd to this directory and type:

  scripts/installer

This will compile the driver, write a configuration
file and update an include file to reflect the name
of your mud.

Review gurba.dgd and change the telnet port
number if so desired.

Now, type 

  bin/driver gurba.dgd

If all went well, you can now connect to the telnet port 
mentioned in the gurba.dgd config file.

The first character logging in will automatically get the
admin role, so be sure its you.
