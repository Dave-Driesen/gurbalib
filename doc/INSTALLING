Getting the LATEST version of DGD and installing
---------------------------------------------------------------------
cd to your gurbalib dir and perform the following actions:
	perl scripts/create_data_dirs.pl
		This creates empty directories that are not stored in the
		repository.  If you do not have perl on your system you can
                just read the script and figure out what directorys to create.
	mkdir src
	cd src

	Download the latest driver from: 
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/dgd-osr/files/
	gzip -d dgd-*.tar.gz
		uncompress the tar file
	tar xvf dgd-*.tar
		extract the tar file.
	cd dgd/src
	edit Makefile if you want networking
		to enable support for intermud and the ftp daemon, change
		the line that looks like:
		DEFINES=-D$(HOST)        #-DNETWORK_EXTENSIONS -DCLOSURES -DCO_THROTTLE=50 -DDUMP_FUNCS
		to:
		DEFINES=-D$(HOST)        -DNETWORK_EXTENSIONS #-DCLOSURES -DCO_THROTTLE=50 -DDUMP_FUNCS
	make
	make install
	cd ../../..
	cp src/dgd/bin/driver ./bin/
        cp mud.dgd.examp mud.dgd
	edit mud.dgd
		change the directory entry to where you installed things.
		Look it over and change other things if you want.
	cd lib/kernel/include
	cp mudname.h.default mudname.h
	edit the mudname.h file and change the mudname
	cd ../../..

	cp contrib/login lib/data/messages/
	cp contrib/motd lib/data/messages/
	You may want to modify these files as well.

	Optionally copy the included emote_d.o file inplace:
	cp contrib/emote_d.o lib/daemons/data/

	cp scripts/startmud bin/startmud
	edit bin/startmud and set ROOT
	bin/startmud

	If all went well, you can now connect to the telnet port 
		mentioned in the mud.dgd config file.
		(4000 by default)

The first character logging in will automatically get the
admin role, so be sure its you.

Gurbalib ships with an ftp server which is enabled by default,
on whatever port you select + 1  if you telnet to 4000
you ftp to 4001.  If you want to disable it, add the following line
to lib/std/include/local_config.h:
#define DISABLE_FTP 1

Have a look at lib/doc/misc/local_config for other things you can define.

OTHER THINGS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want a squeaky clean mud you can also remove the files in
lib/domains/ execpt for required (I would keep them around for
	a little while though since they are semi good example code)

You will want to read the docs that are available and check out
the todo list: lib/TODO
