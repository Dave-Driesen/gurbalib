There are two ways to do this.  Using an install script that
uses the packaged version of dgd or downloading the latest version and
compiling it yourself.  Both are outlined here.  If you want the latest
and greatest version of dgd jump down to LATEST and start there.

Brief installation instructions using the script
-------------------------------------------------------------
CD to your libdir and type the following:
	perl scripts/create_data_dirs.pl
		This creates empty directories that are not stored in the
		repository.
	scripts/installer	(answer the questions)
  		This will compile the driver, write a configuration
		file and update an include file to reflect the name
		of your mud.

	  Review gurba.dgd and change the telnet port number if so desired.
		You will also need to set the directory

	  bin/startmud

	  If all went well, you can now connect to the telnet port 
		mentioned in the gurba.dgd config file.

The first character logging in will automatically get the
admin role, so be sure its you.

Getting the LATEST version of dgd and installing
---------------------------------------------------------------------
cd to your libdir and preform the following actions:
	perl scripts/create_data_dirs.pl
		This creates empty directories that are not stored in the
		repository.
	mkdir src
	cd src

	Download the latest driver from: 
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/dgd-osr/files/
	gzip -d dgd-*.tar.gz
	tar xvfz dgd-*.tar
		extract the tar file.
	cd dgd/src
	make
	make install
	cd ..
	cp bin/driver ../../bin/
	cd ../..
        cp mud.dgd.examp mud.dgd
	edit mud.dgd
		change the directory entry to where you installed things.
		Look it over and change other things if you want.
	cd lib/kernel/include
	cp mudname.h.default mudname.h
	edit the mudname.h file and change the mudname
	cd ../../../
        edit bin/startmud and set ROOT	
	bin/startmud

	If all went well, you can now connect to the telnet port 
		mentioned in the gurba.dgd config file.

XXX  Need to see if the below stuff fits in....

	Need to test script second....

    2. cd contrib/DGD/src && make clean && make && make install && cd ../../../
  - Use either net.dgd or mud.dgd depending on if you are
    using the network package, make sure to edit it to 
    point to the directory where your mud is installed.
  - On DGD versions prior to 1.4 and not using the network package or the ansi
    patches, edit lib/kernel/include/std.h and remove the
    #define SYS_COLOR
    line.
  
  You should now have everything you need and can start the mud
  with:

    bin/driver <yourconfigfile>

admin role, so be sure its you.
