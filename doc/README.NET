DGD-1.2.144-NET-02

This patch is highly experimental, and very likely incomplete.
Don't blame me or any of the other people involved with the
old network package, you have been warned.

It works for my own mud, but this is not thoroughly tested
yet.

This patch is based on the original network package and the
experimental network package for DGD 1.2.37, adapted for
modern dgd versions and extended to handle connect() in non 
blocking mode. 

It also includes the ansi patch.

Included is a network enabled kernel. This is merely an example,
I do not use the kernel library myself.

Tested: 
1. open_port() and listening for tcp connections
2. accepting incomming tcp connections
3. making outgoing tcp connections.

Untested: 
1. UDP
2. long term testing.

What doesn't work:

IPv6 support is not implemented by this package, and has been
disabled.
