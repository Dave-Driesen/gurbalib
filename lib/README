This mudlib is considered a learning tool, so the following file explains
a little bit about the layout of the mud and what you'll find in the following
directories.  If you have any questions email: sirdude (mein@cs.umn.edu)

TODO items are marked with XXX so you can easily grep -r XXX in the
mud and see what needs to be worked on.

If you do not have the mud up and running yet, look at ../doc/INSTALLING
and the other documentation.  (if you do not do this, some of these 
directories may not exist yet.)

	README		This file explaning what each dir has in it.
	TODO		List of todo items not tied to a specific file.
	cmds		Wizard, player and monster commands.
	daemons		Various processes that run on the mud to handle things.
			An example is the event daemon, or the telnet daemon.
	data		Mud specific data files..  Player files, message boards,
			etc...  In general all the user generated content.
	doc		Documentation about the mud... that wizards can view
			via man.  doc/help is for players via help.
	domains		The offical areas of the mud that users can adventure 
			in.  If you want a "clean" mud remove everything
			except for the required subdirectory.  It contains
			the void and the room you start in etc...

			by the mud.
