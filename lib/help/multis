Having multiple characters is allowed on Gurba if you follow a few rules.
The first and probably the most important one is that you notify us. Drop us a
mail a week before you start your new character. If you haven't heard a reply 
within that time, it's OK. You should also tell us why you want to have a 
second character. The reason 'so I can get more gold and power' is NOT an
accepted reason. You must prove to us that you are able to keep the two
characters separate in terms of resources and knowledge. IE, what one character
knows does not automatically get transferred over to the other. 
	It is not good practice to have your characters share equipment or 
money either. In fact, they should not know each other (to begin with). You 
should spend about an equal share of your time playing each character, having 
them logged in at the same time could prove hard to roleplay properly, but it's
not impossible or illegal.
