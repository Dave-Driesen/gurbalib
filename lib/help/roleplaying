Roleplaying is strongly encouraged on Gurba, as it adds to the fantasy
environment that a MUD is basically all about.  As of now, however,
there are no strict rules about roleplaying, and it is all to
your discresion.  HOWEVER, because you CAN discuss out of character
topics doesn't mean you should when there is a perfectly good in
character way of saying it.
