Usage:
	ssay <how|what>

Ssay, short for SuperSay, will let you say something in any way you want. Much
like the say-modifiers. The syntax for ssay is best given with some examples.

> ssay says like he doesn't know what's going on|what's up guys?
Aphex says like he doesn't know what's going on: What's up guys?

> ssay kicks Dran in the pants and says|Muahhahaha!
Aphex kicks Dran in the pannts and says: Muahhahaha!

As you see, it's a fairly powerful command. You have to write the <how> part
like others are going to see it, not as you want to see it yourself. Therefore
this whole command acts a lot like an emote. But it isn't. :)
