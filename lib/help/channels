The channels allow group communication between users of the mud. Since
working with others and communication is the key benefit of an online
system these functions are highly important.

The following are the key commands available:

chan        allows you to use the channels
channels    list all player channels 
chanlist    list all channels (wiz only)

The chan command itself is quite powerful and complex. Basic usage will
be presented below, full syntax will be explained futher down this page.

> chan gossip /on

This will turn the gossip channel on. Note that channel names auto alias to
commands, so that 

> chan gossip /on
and
> gossip /on

are the same.

To speak over the gossip channel, use

> gossip Hello everybody!


Full syntax:

chan <channel> [/switch] [parameter]

Available switches:

/on
    allows players to join a channel

/off
    allows players to leave a channel

emotes / socials
    ;   - You can use the semi-colon to send emotes in channel, best shown 
          in example:

    >  gossip hi everyone
    [gossip] Mordain: Hi everyone
    >  gossip ;smile
    [gossip] Mordain smiles.
