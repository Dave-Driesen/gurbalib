If you abuse bugs, expect to be punished. That's the essence here, We have
the power to undo the benefits you gained from the bug abuse. We have the power
to put your character back on starting level. We have the power to completely
wipe your character. We have the power to give you a little slap on the hand.
It all depends on the seriousness of the bug abuse, how long it has been going
on, whether other people know of it, whether or not you've abused bugs earlier,
and a bunch of other factors like that. But keep this in mind: You abuse bugs 
at your own risk.
