NAME
	call_git - interface with the git command on select directories 
	in the mud.

SYNOPSIS
	nomask int call_git(object thisp, string cmd, string dir, 
	string message)

DESCRIPTION
	This function does not work yet, but will be a simplified version 
	of git to use by wizards/admins on the mud to push/pull updates from 
	a bare server that was setup and configured.  The idea being that 
	wizards can use git to commit files, and this tool to pull in their 
	changes, and or push local changes to the bare repository.
