NAME
	compile_library - compiles an object

SYNOPSIS
	int compile_library(string filepath)

DESCRIPTION
	This command is similar to compile_object, but should be used
	on inheritables instead of standard objects.

	If object is already compiled, it will be upgraded if a newer 
	version exists at filepath.  If filepath is not a legal object an 
	error will result.

	For more info on objects see /doc/misc/objects.

RETURN VALUE
	Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
