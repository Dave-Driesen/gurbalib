Gurbalib uses a custom written kernel.

It was started by Fudge in times now lost to
history. Since then, it has been updated and
enhanced by the Gurbalib resurrection project.

The error handling and dynamic/in-place recompilation
support was ported from Way of the Force.

Many ideas for this kernel come from Dworkin's kernel
library and discussions on the DGD mailinglist.
