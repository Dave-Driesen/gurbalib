Gurbalib uses an include file for some local configurable
options. You'll have to #define things in there to override
the defaults for those options.

When this file doesn't exist, no error will occur, the defaults
will be used. When an option is not defined in this file, the
default for that option will be used.

Useful defines you can put in /include/local_config.h and their 
default values:

To define your email address:

ADMIN_EMAIL             "you@some.place"

To set the linkdeadth timeout (after this linkdead players will be 
disconnected)

LINKDEAD_TIMEOUT        10*60

This defines where players login:

STARTING_ROOM           "/domains/gurba/rooms/square_center"

The max stack depth

MAX_DEPTH               256

This defines how many ticks can be used before an out of ticks
error occurs.

MAX_TICKS               1000000
