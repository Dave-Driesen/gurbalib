/* 
Gurbalib uses an include file for some local configurable
options. You'll have to #define things in there to override
the defaults for those options.

When this file doesn't exist, no error will occur, the defaults
will be used. When an option is not defined in this file, the
default for that option will be used.

Useful defines you can put in /std/include/local_config.h and their 
default values:
