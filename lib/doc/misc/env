Gurbalib uses a number of environment variables,
you can list the ones currently set for your character
with the 'set' command.

You can change them with
set <varname> <value>

and clear them with
unset <varname>

Some userful variables:

width          : [0 or positive int] 
                 terminal width, 0 is unlimited.
height         : [0 or positive int]
                 terminal height
verbose_errors : [0 or 1]
                 show a full call trace when a runtime error
                 occurs
display_caught : [0 or 1]
                 show caught runtime errors
