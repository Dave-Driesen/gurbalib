Usage:
	whisper <person> <message>

	Use this command to whisper something to another character who is 
currently in the same room as you are. Nobody except the two of you will see
the message, but everyone else in the room will be able to see that you are
whispering. It is reccommended that you use whisper instead of tell when the
two of you are in the same room, as that is more realistic.
