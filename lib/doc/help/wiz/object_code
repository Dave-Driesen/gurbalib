Everything in a mud is an object.  The object is the base class for all
items in the mud.  Rooms and monsters are specialized objects with
extra settings in them.  This document will focus on the basics and
show some examples of simple objects.


A minimal object looks like this:
inherit "/std/object";

void setup(void) {
   set_id("rock");
   set_adj("small");
   set_short("A small rock");
   set_long("A pretty boring grey rock.");
   set_gettable(1);
   set_weight(1);
   /* This isn't a special rock... */
   set_value(0);
}

As you can tell, this document needs a lot of love. XXX

Along with rooms and monsters there are some other basic objects that
repeatedly get used, here are some simple examples:

food:	   lib/domains/newbie/obj/potion.c
signs:     lib/domains/newbie/sign.c
weapon:    lib/domains/required/short_sword.c
armor:     lib/domains/required/helmet.c
container: lib/domains/required/chest.c
advanced:  lib/domains/boothill/bandana.c

As you can tell from these examples, you should really poke around the
sample domains to find good examples of how to do things.
