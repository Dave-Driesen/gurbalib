Everything in a mud is an object.  The object is the base class for all
items in the mud.  Rooms and monsters are specialized objects with
extra settings in them.  This document will focus on the basics and
show some examples of simple objects.


A minimal object looks like this:
inherit "/std/object";

void setup(void) {
   set_id("rock");
   set_adj("small");
   set_short("A small rock");
   set_long("A pretty boring grey rock.");
   set_gettable(1);
   set_weight(1);
   /* This isn't a special rock... */
   set_value(0);
}

As you can tell, this document needs a lot of love. XXX
