A minimal room object looks like this:
inherit ROOM;	

void setup( void ) {
  set_brief( "%^MAGENTA%^The void%^RESET%^" );
  set_long( "If you're in here unintentionally, something bugged out. " +
    "Report what you did to the staff." );
  set_exits( ([ 
               "out" : STARTING_ROOM,
  ]) );
}

Lets step through this file and then we can talk about other things you can do
as well.

inherit ROOM;    This line inherits our base class ROOM (which is defined
as /std/room.c in /kernel/include/std.h
This class handles all of our room specific code and makes it easy to create a
simple room, you just create a setup fuction that changes a couple of things
and you have a working room.
