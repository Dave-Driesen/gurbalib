This mud uses a language called LPC its an object oriented language
similar to C.  

Everything in the mud is an object.  The main base objects are:
	OBJECT, MONSTER, ROOM, and PLAYER

objects you create will inherit one of these base classes or another
class baised off of one of these, and then define a function "setup"
Then you'll set various properties and or add functions to the objects 
to make them do all kinds of nifty things.

You probably want to start with rooms, get the hang of them then move to
monsters and then work on objects after that.

There are lots of great examples in /domains.  Start simple and work
your way up to more complex objects.  You can also look at your workroom for
a basic room.

You can read the following documents to learn the basics of these objects:
	room_code monster_code object_code

If you really want to know how it all works take a look at the code behind
these objects, they can all be found in /std
