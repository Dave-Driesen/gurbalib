XXX THIS WHOLE FILE XXX

Just a simple todo list.  If you grep for XXX in the code you'll
find todo's for individual files.  This here is for
higher level concepts and ideas that don't translate well to a given
file currently.

look into using ssh to connect by default.  telnet is dead... ;)

look into a "git" interface for security and editing files.
Need to research writeable files for wizards/admins and see what
makes sense.

Make m_aggressive or something similar...
	not sure I like the m_  syntax and or system

Make it so there are logs only admins can view? 

Party system (invite, follow, say, report)
Clans
m_guild_trainer, m_trainer
m_lightable
m_lockable, keys
m_switchable, Levers
m_throwable
m_writable
ladders/stairs, portals
tracking of most used rooms, objects
auto dest/update of all instances of an object
PK system (announcing, death announcing)
Combat styles
support for getting 2nd or 3rd sword in a room or inv
Weight of objects
Bank

restructure doc and doc/help directory
	help/wiz seems odd as well...?
	Need to write intro wiz documentation
	maybe a newbie admin doc as well...

Come up with some standards for combat/exp skills

Why sys/obj/user/telnet.c  it just inherits /sys/lib/user right now ???
	if you look at kernel/include/std.h it defines:
kernel/include/std.h:#define TELNET_USER_OB  "/sys/obj/user/telnet"
kernel/include/std.h:#define SSH_USER_OB     "/sys/obj/user/ssh"
kernel/include/std.h:#define HTTP_USER_OB    "/sys/obj/user/http"
kernel/include/std.h:#define FTP_USER_OB     "/sys/obj/user/ftp_command"
	so it should maybe be more modular???

figure out why query_users, query_players, users()  do we need all of them?
	query_users() you need to do ->query_player()  why
	find_user(string str)  you also need to do a ->query_player() odd...

Also look at query_Name vs query_name and friends... seems like there
are a few overlaps that are not needed...

Look at set_in_room_desc, set_brief, etc...  very messy right now...

fix  You wield your the shield.

Need to review See Also: in -h options...

why /daemons, /kernel/daemons, /sys/daemons
    /sys, /kernel/sys, 
   /sys/lib, /kernel/lib
/daemons/data /data /kernel/daemons/data /sys/data /sys/daemons/data

Still need to modify add_item_command so that it uses function names from
add_object_command...

Fix it so deep inventory works with autoload.

Make it so language_d uses race->query_language() and if english ignore
	race stuff...

score doesn't say what race you are...
