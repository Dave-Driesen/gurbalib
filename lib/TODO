XXX THIS WHOLE FILE XXX

Just a simple todo list.  If you grep for XXX in the code you'll
find todo's for individual files.  This here is for
higher level concepts and ideas that don't translate well to a given
file currently.

look into using ssh to connect by default.  telnet is dead... ;)

look into a "git" interface for security and editing files.
Need to research writeable files for wizards/admins and see what
makes sense.

Party system (invite, say, report), Clans, Expand Guilds
PK system (announcing, death announcing)
m_lockable, keys
m_switchable, Levers
m_throwable
ladders/stairs, portals
tracking of most used rooms, objects
auto dest/update of all instances of an object

Why sys/obj/user/telnet.c  it just inherits /sys/lib/user right now ???
	if you look at kernel/include/std.h it defines:
kernel/include/std.h:#define TELNET_USER_OB  "/sys/obj/user/telnet"
kernel/include/std.h:#define SSH_USER_OB     "/sys/obj/user/ssh"
kernel/include/std.h:#define HTTP_USER_OB    "/sys/obj/user/http"
kernel/include/std.h:#define FTP_USER_OB     "/sys/obj/user/ftp_command"
	so it should maybe be more modular???

figure out why query_users, query_players, users()  do we need all of them?
	query_users() you need to do ->query_player()  why
	find_user(string str)  you also need to do a ->query_player() odd...

Also look at query_Name vs query_name and friends... 
seems like there are a few overlaps that are not needed...

Look at set_in_room_desc, set_brief, etc...  very messy right now...

fix  You wield your the shield.

why /daemons, /kernel/daemons, /sys/daemons
    /sys, /kernel/sys, 
   /sys/lib, /kernel/lib
/daemons/data /data /kernel/daemons/data /sys/data /sys/daemons/data

Still need to modify add_item_command so that it uses function names from
add_object_command...

support for getting 2nd or 3rd sword in a room or inv
Fix it so deep inventory works with autoload.

Fix bunny so that it doesn't attack you second time you pick flower...
In combat the bunny does't always attack...
In combat the monsters get players hp durring battle sometimes???
	it has to do with shifting of this_player() for messages I think...

remove extranious *.o files... guild_d.o for example...
	after figure that out update clean up scripts to clean up correctly.

Start using weight for picking up things, and for how much a bag
can hold......

Fix giving coins so it creates a money object...

set_this_player is used too much... mabye only need it in heart_beat,
and or in sys/ib/player.c and sys/lib/user.c  Shouldn't need it in
all the locations its used...

Fix it so room and or object commands look at return value to determine if
they actually work or not...
See play piano in /domains/boothill/rooms/saloon.c for an example.

Fix rooms not loading objects so it loads the singularity(sing.c)

Guild master uses "say join, say leave"  seems odd why not do room_commands
	(Seems like it doesn't always work as well...)

Fix up Events like body_enter body_leave  good way to do 
gurba monsters that talk when things happen I think...
Harry...

Document objects and rooms and monters.
