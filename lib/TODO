XXX THIS WHOLE FILE XXX

Just a simple todo list.  If you grep for XXX in the code you'll
find todo's for individual files.  This here is for
higher level concepts and ideas that don't translate well to a given
file currently.

look into using ssh to connect by default.  telnet is dead... ;)

look into a "git" interface for security and editing files.
Need to research writeable files for wizards/admins and see what
makes sense.

Fix:
	You grab your the stick (wield it)

COMBAT
	Make m_aggressive or something similar...
		not sure I like the m_  syntax and or system
	figure out scheme when you die?
		clone corpse, drop everything, move to void?
		if make it back to body before timeout or someone loots
		you get everything. (Need to figure out looting as well
			then...)
		have empty bodys decompse faster than bodys that still have
		something in them.  Could just put "exp on the body
		 like demon souls..."

	move race and guild commands to player and have a "skill" 
		the the command depends on.

        Make it so there are logs only admins can view?

restructure doc and doc/help directory
	help/wiz seems odd as well...?
	Need to write intro wiz documentation
	maybe a newbie admin doc as well...

Come up with some standards for combat/exp skills
make -h work for verbs

Need to make an interface for global aliases like n = north
	or figure out what it is if it already exists???


Why sys/obj/user/telnet.c  it just inherits /sys/lib/user right now ???
	if you look at kernel/include/std.h it defines:
kernel/include/std.h:#define TELNET_USER_OB  "/sys/obj/user/telnet"
kernel/include/std.h:#define SSH_USER_OB     "/sys/obj/user/ssh"
kernel/include/std.h:#define HTTP_USER_OB    "/sys/obj/user/http"
kernel/include/std.h:#define FTP_USER_OB     "/sys/obj/user/ftp_command"
	so it should maybe be more modular???

make it so that /data/players/sirdude.o and
sys/daemons/data/users/s/sirdude.o are more similar...
Also need to figure out a maildir for users:
data/mail/s/sirdude.o   or something similar...
(maybe also a data/mail/s/sirdude.hdr file as well, can be computed from 
	the first though.)
something like a function that returns players/s/sirdude.o given sirdude
that we can add to a prefix....
