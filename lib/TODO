XXX THIS WHOLE FILE XXX

Just a simple todo list.  If you grep for XXX in the code you'll
find todo's for individual files.  This here is for
higher level concepts and ideas that don't translate well to a given
file currently.

look into using ssh to connect by default.  telnet is dead... ;)

look into a "git" interface for security and editing files.
Need to research writeable files for wizards/admins and see what
makes sense.

Work on install script so it's smoother/smarter.
	update instructions for how to get started....

Fix:
	You grab your the stick (wield it)

	Make m_aggressive or something similar...
		not sure I like the m_  syntax and or system

	move race and guild commands to player and have a "skill" 
		the the command depends on.

        Make it so there are logs only admins can view? 

Add players age to score.....
