XXX THIS WHOLE FILE XXX

Just a simple todo list.  If you grep for XXX in the code you'll
find todo's for individual files.  This here is for higher level concepts 
and ideas that don't translate well to a given file currently.

look into using ssh to connect by default.  telnet is dead... ;)

look into a "git" interface for security and editing files.
Need to research writeable files for wizards/admins and see what
makes sense.

m_lockable, keys
m_switchable, Levers
tracking of most used rooms, objects
auto dest/update of all instances of an object

Old stuff from ../doc/TODO:
- Add linked list support to auto object
- Mask destruct_object() to deregister objects and clones
- Ensure a create function in the auto object gets called
  to register new objects/clones
- Mask new_object() to check for valid LWO master objects
- Rewrite fake objects module to use LWOs
- Seperate inheritables from clonables
- Add TLS support to the driver object
- Rewrite object_d to track inheritance
- Change update to deal with inheritables
- Change update to allow updating all depending objects

Fix it so deep inventory works with autoload.

Fix bunny so that it doesn't attack you second time you pick flower...
In combat the bunny does't always attack...

weight started, need to get it working against str for players and how
	much they can carry.

Fix rooms not loading objects so it loads the singularity(sing.c)

Fix up Events like body_enter body_leave  good way to do 
gurba monsters that talk when things happen I think...
Harry...

Need to convert Monster item_command stuff to object_commands

chan, and mudlist shouldn't return cached stuff if not connected?

locate username   (for finding people on other muds, i3locate in dead souls)
mail "user@mud" support...

write a showtree command that shows an objects inherit list?

locate command gives:
Intermud error 'unk-type' received from Ulario
Unhandled packet type: locate-req

rebuild - doesn't give an error...

rwho sirdude gives a very cryptic error message.

Fix it so not all domains are banned, only select list.  Otherwise can't
have a domain named after a wizard, it auto bans that wizard.
	Probably not a good solution.

after possess rat
	$>  cmds
	$Runtime error: Value is not an int
	$>  ls
	$Runtime error: Bad argument 2 to normalize_path (needs string)
	$>  cd
	$Runtime error: Bad argument 2 to normalize_path (needs string)

Move more of std/obj/player.c:receive_message() to m_cmds.c:do_game_command()

Modify combat so you can have multiple damage messages for a given weapon???
	like the swiss army knife in eotl...

Fix it so list works when objects don't compile.

Fix listen and possibly search, it's not working right...

When you first login on mud creation, you must logout 
	before getting "admin rights"

For /domains/boothill/rooms/mine/squeeze.c
	Error: /domains/boothill/monters/kobold is not an object
Note it also does not log any errors for this....

Look into MPX support, MCCP or KaVir's MUD Protocol Handler
	http://www.mudbytes.net/file-2811

do_game_command should look at full command path, right now it doesn't...
	This is a perms issue at this point.

Fix it so you can do the following:
	possess rat
	call -h

work on some sort of stats:
	How frequently a room is accessed.
	How frequently a monster is killed.
	How frequently a monster kills a player.
	Loot distribution against challenge difficulty.

add a rest/stand command where you gain hp otherwise you don't...
Add fullness/intoxication to score output...

 a built in history command, for the last 20 commands
#! preforms the last executed command
#$ preforms the last word of the last executed command.
#(num) preforms that command from the history
#(string) preforms the last history command starting with (string)

creator command lists the creator of an object/room.

query command, example query bull:
You look long and hard at Bull considering his worth.
Bull is a threat level 1.097 to you.
Bull is worth 545 exp.

a bot spams random hints to the info channel every so often.

defend command allows you to proctect another player.
Things attacking it will attack you instead.

grep for ifdef's and make sure all are documented and useful.

Fix check and checkmud functions so that they continue on errors.
Also fix it so we avoid the too many objects error...
