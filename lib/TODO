XXX THIS WHOLE FILE XXX

Just a simple todo list.  If you grep for XXX in the code you'll
find todo's for individual files.  This here is for
higher level concepts and ideas that don't translate well to a given
file currently.

look into using ssh to connect by default.  telnet is dead... ;)

look into a "git" interface for security and editing files.
Need to research writeable files for wizards/admins and see what
makes sense.

Work on install script so it's smoother/smarter.
	remove empty dirs from git since there is a script to create them.
	update instructions for how to get started....
	will need to create wiz dir since its empty by default now...

Fix:
	You grab your the stick (wield it)

	Make m_aggressive or something similar...
		not sure I like the m_  syntax.....

	move race and guild commands to player and have a "skill" 
		the the command depends on.

        Make it so there are logs only admins can view? 

Add players age to score.....
