XXX THIS WHOLE FILE XXX

Just a simple todo list.  If you grep for XXX in the code you'll
find todo's for individual files.  This here is for higher level concepts 
and ideas that don't translate well to a given file currently.

look into using ssh to connect by default.  telnet is dead... ;)

look into a "git" interface for security and editing files.
Need to research writeable files for wizards/admins and see what
makes sense.

m_lockable, keys
m_switchable, Levers
tracking of most used rooms, objects
auto dest/update of all instances of an object

Fix it so deep inventory works with autoload.

Fix bunny so that it doesn't attack you second time you pick flower...
In combat the bunny does't always attack...

weight started, need to get it working against str for players and how
	much they can carry.

set_this_player is used too much... mabye only need it in heart_beat,
and or in sys/ib/player.c and sys/lib/user.c  Shouldn't need it in
all the locations its used...

Fix rooms not loading objects so it loads the singularity(sing.c)

Fix up Events like body_enter body_leave  good way to do 
gurba monsters that talk when things happen I think...
Harry...

Document objects and rooms and monters.

Need to convert Monster item_command stuff to object_commands

chan, and mudlist shouldn't return cached stuff if not connected?

locate username   (for finding people on other muds, i3locate in dead souls)
mail "user@mud" support...

Fix wiz commands: more.c cat.c so they do not choke on larger files.

write a showtree command that shows an objects inherit list?

Add [link-dead] stuff to who maybe also last?

locate command gives:
Intermud error 'unk-type' received from Ulario
Unhandled packet type: locate-req

rebuild - doesn't give an error...

rwho sirdude gives a very cryptic error message.

Fix it so not all domains are banned, only select list.  Otherwise can't
have a domain named after a wizard, it auto bans that wizard.
	Probably not a good solution.

after possess rat
	$>  cmds
	$Runtime error: Value is not an int
	$>  ls
	$Runtime error: Bad argument 2 to normalize_path (needs string)
	$>  cd
	$Runtime error: Bad argument 2 to normalize_path (needs string)

Move more of std/obj/player.c:receive_message() to m_cmds.c:do_game_command()

Modify combat so you can have multiple damage messages for a given weapon???
	like the swiss army knife in eotl...

Fix it so list works when objects don't compile.

Fix listen and possibly search, it's not working right...

When you first login on mud creation, you must logout 
	before getting "admin rights"

For /domains/boothill/rooms/mine/squeeze.c
	Error: /domains/boothill/monters/kobold is not an object
Note it also does not log any errors for this....

Look into MPX support, MCCP or KaVir's MUD Protocol Handler
	http://www.mudbytes.net/file-2811

do_game_command should look at full command path, right now it doesn't...
	This is a perms issue at this point.

Fix it so you can do the following:
	possess rat
	call -h

work on some sort of stats:
	How frequently a room is accessed.
	How frequently a monster is killed.
	How frequently a monster kills a player.
	Loot distribution against challenge difficulty.

Fix perms so guest user works, right now it fails at login.

Check aliass so that you can't make an empty alias.
check aliasadm after thats done as well.
