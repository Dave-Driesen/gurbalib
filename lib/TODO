XXX THIS WHOLE FILE XXX

Just a simple todo list.  If you grep for XXX in the code you'll
find todo's for individual files.  This here is for
higher level concepts and ideas that don't translate well to a given
file currently.

look into using ssh to connect by default.  telnet is dead... ;)

look into a "git" interface for security and editing files.
Need to research writeable files for wizards/admins and see what
makes sense.

finish usage on commands.  Figure out usage for verbs...
can find todo's with grep -L usage in the cmds dirs...

If you remove a helmet it breaks your player until you logout and back in..

Work on install script so it's smoother/smarter.
	remove empty dirs from git since there is a script to create them.
	update instructions for how to get started....
	will need to create wiz dir since its empty by default now...

Fix:
	You grab your the stick (wield it)
	break branch has some security stuff happening so stick isn't 
		created right.
	/std/corpse is not an object when dying????
