XXX THIS WHOLE FILE XXX

Just a simple todo list.  If you grep for XXX in the code you'll
find todo's for individual files.  This here is for
higher level concepts and ideas that don't translate well to a given
file currently.

look into using ssh to connect by default.  telnet is dead... ;)

look into a "git" interface for security and editing files.
Need to research writeable files for wizards/admins and see what
makes sense.

finish usage on commands.  Figure out usage for verbs...
can find todo's with grep -L usage in the cmds dirs...
remove/combine a lot of commands right now too many...

mv cmds command to players need to figure out if its a security issue.

make it so mudlib is fudge and spud clean:
	remove references to their names in std files/commands
	mv files that leave it to gurba domain
	if leave wizdirs make names unusable and or note in install
	script
