Welcome to Sirdude's(aka Kent Mein) branch of the Gurbalib.

I played on various muds in my college years and am a UNIX Sys Admin.  
I've been playing lots of minecraft with my kids lately and want them
to get into UNIX and programming.  So I started tinkering with muds
again.  I downloaded DGD and went in pursuit of a mudlib.

If your reading this you probably have had a similar quest and have
found that the stuff that is out there is old, sparse, not fully
functional and or some mixture of the above.

All the documentation I found stated if you want to get a mud running
quickly with DGD go with gurba at this point.  It's basically ready to
run.

So I grabbed what I could and gave it a shot.  After a couple of
months of playing with things, I think I have a pretty good handle of
where things are at.  I don't like everything about the mudlib but
its a great start and something to move forward with.

My goals are to simplify things, and make a consistent, well documented,
functional mudlib that anyone can use as a base for a mud.

If your just getting started with the Gurbalib take a look at
doc/INSTALLING and the other documents in doc, then look at
the documentation in lib/doc and basically everything in lib since
that is the important stuff.
